# Gem Mayhem - Unity workshop for GCS !

Gem Mayhem is a simple 3D game where you run around and collect all the gems. This project contains assets and some bare-bones code to implement Gem Mayhem.

# Lesson Plan

The workshop will be an hour long and will be geared towards beginners.
 
 1) Finish the character prefab. Become comfortable with the editor and how components work.
 2) Add gems to the scene. Learn about transforms and become using assets from other packages and manipulating scenes and prefabs.
 3) Implement gem pickup. Use colliders and audio source components and become comfortable using scripts.
 4) Set up a basic main menu. Practice making UI and loading scenes.
 
 # Extension 
 A somewhat complete version of Gem Mayhem can be found in the "completed" branch of this repository. Here are some extension ideas in case we finish early: 
 
 1) Add a walking animation to the character prefab. Learn how to use Animation Controllers and think through transition logic.
 2) Add a gem counter.  Build upon scripting and UI skills.
 3) Add an end scene for collecting gems or for falling off.  Build upon scripting and UI skills.
